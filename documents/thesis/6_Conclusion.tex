\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transport lemma from heap lang to extended languages to avoid adding many heap lang features to these languages.
    \item Extending the case study with more operating system primitives.
    \item There are other approaches to concurrency in OCaml using effect handlers without the higher-order suspend effect. It would be interesting to also study them and see if the formalization
          turns out to be easier.
\end{itemize}
